# Daily Programming Practice

Welcome to my Daily Programming Practice repository! This repository is dedicated to storing the programs I work on daily to improve my skills in various programming languages and concepts. Each day, I add new code snippets, exercises, and solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and others.

## Repository Structure

- **`/typescript/`**: TypeScript programs and exercises.
- **`/javascript/`**: JavaScript programs and exercises.
- **`/sql/`**: SQL queries and exercises.
- **`/other/`**: Programs in other languages or concepts.

## How to Contribute

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   cd repository
2. **Create a New Folder** for your daily practice or a specific language if it doesnâ€™t already exist:
   ```sh
   mkdir typescript # or javascript, sql, etc.

4. **Stage and Commit Your Changes:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new TypeScript exercise for [date]"
  
4. **Push to Remote:**
   ```sh
   git push origin main
